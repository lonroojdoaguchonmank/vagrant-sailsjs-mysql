Getting started

This is a portable development environment for SailsJS and MySQL using Vagrant.
Primarily aimed at those would like to learn more about full stack development. This environment is fully contained in the VM and should be less intimidating then trying to figure out all the dependencies, installation issues etc...

I would suggest using one of the following package managers for your platform;

Windws: Cholatey, https://chocolatey.org/
Mac: Homebrew, http://brew.sh/
Linux: You know what you need to do already!

Prerequisites

Vagrant
VirtualBox
VirtualBox Extention Pack


To get started execute the following in a terminal.

vagrant box add minimal/jessie64
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

Enjoy!!!

Things worthy of note

All projects should be created under the projects directory, that way you can use your favourite editor.

/home/vagrant/projects => ./projects

The MySQL DBMS address is in the variable $DBMS_IP
And can be accessed with the following credentials;

username: application
password: password
